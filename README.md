# api-client-typescript

Official TypeScript client for interacting with the [Nash Exchange](https://nash.io/).

- [Github repository](https://github.com/nash-io/api-client-typescript)
- [Documentation](https://nash-io.github.io/api-client-typescript)

To test your integrations, Nash provides a public sandbox environment at https://app.sandbox.nash.io.

NOTE: In sandbox, testnet funds are automatically sent to new accounts. The sandbox environment is reset every couple of days.

## Installation

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```
  cmake
  make
  gcc
  gmp-devel
  openssl-devel
  clang
  npm
```

```sh
yarn add @neon-exchange/api-client-typescript
```

## Getting started

To get started you need to create an API key. You can find instructions on how to do so further down in this Readme.
Remember, API Keys contain sensitive infomation, if you are using version control be careful not to store the key in the repository.

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  Client,
  EnvironmentConfiguration
} from '@neon-exchange/api-client-typescript'

const nash = new Client(EnvironmentConfiguration.sandbox)

const run = async () => {
  const markets = await nash.listMarkets()
  console.log(markets)
}

run()
```

Note: You can use either `EnvironmentConfiguration.production` or `EnvironmentConfiguration.sandbox`.

## Authentication

Most Nash API requests require the client to be authenticated. This is needed to sign the payloads being sent over the wire.

```typescript
import {
  Client,
  EnvironmentConfiguration,
  CryptoCurrency
} from '@neon-exchange/api-client-typescript'

const nash = new Client(EnvironmentConfiguration.sandbox)

const run = async () => {
  try {
    await nash.login(require('PATH_TO_KEY.json'))
    const balance = await nash.getAccountBalance(CryptoCurrency.NEO)
    console.log(balance)
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e)
  }
}

run()
```

## Websockets

You can use websockets subscriptions like this:

```typescript
import {
  Client,
  EnvironmentConfiguration
} from '@neon-exchange/api-client-typescript'

const nash = new Client(EnvironmentConfiguration.sandbox)
await nash.login(require('PATH_TO_KEY.json'))

const connection = nash.createSocketConnection()

// Getting the orderbook for the neo_eth marked
connection.onUpdatedOrderbook(
  { marketName: 'neo_eth' },
  {
    onResult: ({
      data: {
        updatedOrderBook: { bids, asks }
      }
    }) => {
      console.log(`updated bids ${bids.length}`)
      console.log(`updated asks ${asks.length}`)
    }
  }
)

// Getting the user orderobok for all markets
connection.onUpdatedAccountOrders(
  {},
  {
    onResult: ({ data: { updatedAccountOrders } }) => {
      console.log(`Updated orders: {updatedAccountOrders.length}`)
    }
  }
)
```

## Setting up API keys

Setting up an API key is very easy. Start by navigating to your profile page, from the profile page, click on the API Keys tab, and click on the 'Generate new key' to open a create API Key wizard.
After going through the wizard. Remember to save your API key, and store it somewhere accessible to your project.

[This video](https://youtu.be/5DQ0PCbCwkI) shows how to set up a new API Key.

## API key policies & transferring funds to external wallets

Using API keys allows users to apply policies to operations performed by the SDK. One such operation is to transfer funds to external accounts. This is done by using the transferToExternal method on the Client.
Before being allowed to send funds, addresses have to be explicitly whitelisted. Otherwise the all calls to the method will result in a permission violation.

Whitelisted addresses can be set up both before and after creating the API key. [This video](https://youtu.be/5hAa3FqknFA) shows how to whitelist two addresses for an API key.

## State signing

In order to assure your blockchain balances remain in sync with your trading balances, the client must 'sign' their state every so often before placing more orders. By default, the client will take care of this in the background for you and you will not need to worry about this.

In special cases where a user has more than one client process running at once which is placing a high volume of orders, it is advisable to take a more custom approach. To turn of auto state syncing, initialize the client like so:

```
const nash = new Client(EnvironmentConfiguration.sandbox, {autoSignState: false})
```

You will then be responsible for signing states when necessary. The current restriction is that states must be signed every 100 open orders, so the client should keep track and make sure to sign state before this limit is reached, otherwise placing an order will raise an error.

This is done using the following call:

```
const states = await client.getSignAndSyncStates()
```

If you are running a high volume of orders from different clients on the same account and having difficulty managing this process, please reach out to support and we will be glad to help with an optimal solution.
